# Facade Pattern Implementation

## Task Description

### Task 1

1. Use the weather service [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) to retrieve weather information.
2. Design a facade for this service. The facade should provide a simplified interface, e.g., a method that returns the current temperature in a given city.
3. Create a console-based user interface that allows the user to select a city and displays the current temperature in that city.
4. Implement the facade to interact with the external API, fetch weather data, and expose a simplified interface for the user interface.
5. Test the application to ensure that:
   - The facade works correctly.
   - The simplified user interface interacts properly with the external API.
