# Prototype Design Pattern

## Task Description

### Task 1

### Steps to Complete:

1. Create a class called `Orc`.
2. Create a new instance of the `Orc` class.
3. Using serialization and deserialization, create multiple clones of the new `Orc` object in a loop and add them to a collection.
4. Randomly modify one of their attributes, such as `strength`.
5. Use [Newtonsoft JSON](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/SerializingJSON.htm) for serialization and deserialization.
