# Proxy Pattern Implementation

## Task Description

### Task 1

1. Create two classes. One should represent an object that is accessible without restrictions, and the other a restricted object (access limited by a password).
2. Design a proxy that will control access to the objects by verifying whether the provided password is correct.
3. Create a console-based user interface that allows the user to choose an object to access and input a password.
4. Test the application to ensure the proxy works correctly and controls access to the objects.
