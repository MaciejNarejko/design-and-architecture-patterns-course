# Bridge Pattern

## Task Description

### Task

Imagine a desktop in our operating system. For Windows, it is usually obvious that we will use a graphical interface. However, a Linux user can choose their interface.

We want to avoid permanently binding the interface to the operating system.

Implement appropriate classes (e.g., `System`, `LinuxSystem`, `Interface`, `GraphicInterface`).

Establish relationships between these elements using the **Bridge Pattern**.

Test the correctness of the solution. When pressing the menu button in our interface, the system should return a list of installed programs. (For this task, it will be a console call to the `displayMenu` function).
