# Adapter Pattern

## Task Description

### Task

Our goal is to outsmart the bouncer at a nightclub.

Our 17-year-old Krzy≈õ wants to get into the club and dance, but he fails the validation (e.g., the `IsAdult` method).

Write an adapter class `FakeAdult` that inherits from the `Adult` class.

The adapter's task is to bypass the validation and allow our hero to enter and enjoy the club.
